    "\n",
    "## Introduction \n",
    "\n",
    "In the last lab, we learned how to build a small neural network from scratch, with only numpy to help.  While this was illuminating to help us learn how Artificial Neural Networks actually work, the construction of it was a bit too tedious for real-world data scientists to do on the job. Because of this, many great frameworks and libraries have been created to make it a simple task to build a neural network--Keras, and TensorFlow!\n",

    "## A Bit of Background\n",
    "\n",
    "If we're going to talk about Keras, we'll first need to talk about TensorFlow.  Keras and TensorFlow are both created and maintained by Google.  TensorFlow is a framework for building **_Static Computational Graphs_**, with a special emphasis on Deep Learning.  It provides much of the same functionality of numpy, but with a ton of common functionality needed for neural networks already created. Since working with TensorFlow can be a bit involved, Keras was invented as a high-level API for building Neural Networks with TensorFlow as a backend.  When you're using Keras, you're still using TensorFlow--you just don't have to write any TensorFlow code directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The biggest benefit of using TensorFlow or Keras is that they provide [Auto Differentiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_differentiation) by default, which means that we don't actually have to handle Back Propagation, or caching any of the intermediate values during our forward propagation step so that we can use them later in back prop.  This is just one of the many reasons you'll love working with these tools!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting Started\n",

    "We'll start by building a small MLP with Keras.  Run the cell below to import everything we'll need for this lab."

Each image is black and white, 28 pixel high, 28 pixels wide, and comes with a label.  From a historical perspective, this dataset has incredible significance to the Deep Learning community.  These days, it is treated as the \"Hello, World!\" of Deep Learning.  \n",
